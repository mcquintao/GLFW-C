# GLFW Learn Project #

Project created to test and learn about comp. graphics.
I intend to learn about C lang, Cmake, GLFW, OpenGL and Vulkan.
Maybe some day I can apply this new knoladge to dev some games/game engine.
Another thing that I wanna to try is implement a gcode visualizer tool and cost/budget calculator
for 3d printing stuff.
Actualy my curiosity over GLFW came from the Slic3r and OrcaSlicer softwares (open source slicer). If I successfully learn about this things I can try to load my own budget tool inside the OrcaSlicer.
